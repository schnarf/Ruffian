- Use proper smart pointers in the parser. There are lots of places where parse errors
  can cause leaks. The AST should at least use unique_ptr or something too; it's being leaked.
- Clean up error messages in lexer, parser, and codegen. Errors should also be emitted with
  references to the line number and position where the error was encountered.
- Consider changing the conditional statement definition. It may be simpler if it
  can take any statement, not just blocks.

- Clean up error messages in lexer, parser, and codegen. Errors should also be emitted with
  references to the line number and position where the error was encountered.
- Consider changing the conditional statement definition. It may be simpler if it
  can take any statement, not just blocks.
- Fix parseExpression(). It's awful.
- Have some precedence other than left to right for binary operators
- Resolve the issue with function definitions inside of functions. Either disallow them,
  or mangle the name so that there's no problem at codegen time
- Work out and implement some implicit/explicit type conversions.
